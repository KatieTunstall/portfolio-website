<h2>My story</h2>
<p>British born, at 23, I moved to Australia to help a friend set-up a photography studio. 15 years later, the company now has an annual turnover of $13m.
During those early days, it was clear that I had a natural intrigue into making systems more efficient. This was warmly welcomed, and I was responsible for designing and implementing systems in all areas of the business.
Fast forward 10 years, and I am now taking a year out in Cape Town, South Africa due to my partners work. I approached a photography company to create an SAAS. The service would allow photographers to upload their imagery, produce finished artwork, and provide an online store for their clients to view, and purchase artwork. I gained huge experience being the project manager, responsible for the whole team including web developers and designers.
For the last 5 years, I have been working building my UX portfolio, including digital design using Adobe XD, and other research projects including heuristic analysis of existing websites, and annotation of user studies
