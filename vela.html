        <p>A case study showcasing user research, usability testing,
          prototyping, and iterative process of a personalised weather

        <p>Overview: Vela is an IOS app for water sports enthusiasts. It makes
          personalised location and water sport recommendations for the current
          weather conditions. It also offers an educational platform for users
          who wish to expand their knowledge of weather.
          <p>Problem: How can water sports enthusiasts get access to weather
          information to help them enjoy the best conditions and stay safe in
          the water? Especially if they don’t understand weather reports?</p>
          <p>  Goal: Create an app for water users who have struggled with weather
            apps in the past. This project was created as part of my UX design
            course.</p>

            <h3>#1 Discover - 1.1 Competitive & swot analysis, 1.2 In-person
              interviews 1.3 Empathy mapping</h3>
            <p>1.1 - Competitive & swot analysis - I started by identifying potential competitors and analysing their offerings with a Competitive & Swot analysis. There is certainly no shortage when it comes to weather apps. In fact, the sheer
              volume was quite overwhelming. I reviewed over 50 apps. I chose Magic Seaweed (MSW) to conduct an in-depth analysis on as this seemed to be the most popular app.
              <p>1.2 - In-person interviews - Next, I talked to 3 of my friends who are avid water users to find out more about their own experiences with weather apps. The highlights of my findings were:
              <p>Only one of my friends said she found weather apps hard to use. As I also have experienced difficulty in the past, I assumed everyone felt the same, so it was extremely insightful to find this is not true for everyone, so early on in my
              research.</p>
              <p>Digging deeper, I found the main reason she had given up using apps in the past, was because she found the information too hard to understand. She said she would love to be guided as to where and when it was safe to swim in the ocean,
              rather than having to decipher complex information herself.</p>
              <p>The other two friends reported that they were frustrated with their current weather apps because they were unreliable, and even though they were quite experienced, they still often found the information hard to understand.
              “I don’t use a weather app at the moment, although I really need one, as I’m swimming a lot and need to know if the conditions are safe. I have tried them in the past, but I get frustrated as the information is too confusing for me.”—
              Rebecca</p>
              <p>1.3 - Empathy mapping - Using Empathy mapping, I explored more about the wants, need & emotions of my potential users.
              The most valuable highlights were:
              Users want accurate, reliable information, quickly.
              Users would like to learn about the weather while using the app.
              Most users spend less than 10 minutes using the app at any one time.</p>

                  2.3 Sitemap & iteration</h3>
                <p>2.1 - Primary persona & user needs - There were 2 clear types of user; those that had prior experience, and those that had little/no experience and really needed their hand-held. Being most like me, I decided to direct the app
                  towards the more in-experienced user. I feel there is a big potential market for a product like this.
                  <p>From here, I created my Primary persona ‘Rebecca’. I defined her 3 top user needs:</p>
                  <p>“Get a personalised recommendation on a location based on my specific needs, so I feel safe in the water”</p>
                <p>“Be able to learn about the weather whilst using the app”</p>
                  <p>“Be able to view a location refined by sport”</p>

                      </picture>
                  <p>2.2 Card sorting - Now I had my primary persona designed, I conducted an online card sort with 12 participants who were all keen water users. This helped me understand how their minds worked in regards to information hierarchy. From
                  here, I was able to start to creating my sitemap.</p>
                  <p>2.3 Sitemap & iteration - Below is the initial sitemap I created. The main idea being that the user can check the recommendations, and then choose either by sport, or by location. Upon further review from my tutor, multiple issues
                  became apparent.
                  <p>‘How can the app make recommendations on locations and sports if it doesn’t know what you want?’ Solution - user needs to make a profile with sport and location preferences to allow the app to generate the recommendations.</p>
                  <p>‘There are many clicks the user needs to do to get the weather information. Remember that users want information quickly’ Solution - Remove tutorials as a main category, allowing the main screen to be the most important items; ie
                  weather information and recommendations.</p>
                  <p>‘How can you look up a location quickly?’ There is no way for a user to quickly search a location. Solution - Include a search bar!</p>

                    <h3>#3 Ideate - 3.1 Low fidelity wireframes, 3.2 Mid-fidelity wireframes, 3.3 Creating interactive prototype</h3>
                    <p>3.1 Low fidelity wireframes- Below you can see the initial wireframe ideation for creating a profile. As the user is yet to experience the features of the app, the main consideration during this phase, was to keep this process
                      as minimal as possible, but still obtaining the most important information. The most important information required:
                      Sports choice
                      Location preferences
                      Which of these locations the user wishes to be notified of.
                      To enable the user to add locations efficiently, they can either search for a specific location, or add a location directly from the map.
                      <p>3.2 Mid fidelity wireframes- The next step was to get some feedback on my initial wireframes. The following issues were raised:
                      ‘How will the app know how to recommend sports and locations, if it doesn’t know the users fitness level? Someone may be a beginner, but the weather conditions may be great for an advanced surfer’. Solution - add an additional
                      step, where the user will add their ability level for each sport they select.</p>
                      <p>3.3 Creating interactive prototype - Once I had reviewed the mid-fidelity wireframes, I started to design the interactive prototype using Adobe XD. At this stage it was about making a functioning prototype ready for testing. The
                      design was made in black and white, and with no imagery or icons, so as not to distract the users with UI aspects.</p>

                            <p>5.1 User testing - I moderated in-person user testing sessions with 6 participants. The users were selected due to their experience with using weather apps in the past.
                              <p>5.2 Results - The testing session was extremely insightful. I used Affinity mapping and a Rainbow spreadsheet to collate the information into manageable chunks. The rainbow spreadsheet helped me to recognise major issues
                              with my design.</p>
                              <p>5.3 Iterations - Now I had this information, I was able to collate the top priority issues. These were defined as:
                              <p>#1 Users searched to change sport preferences under the profile section. Solution - Expand the profile page.</p>
                              <p>#2 User did not understand the purpose of the notifications. Solution - Educate users when creating their profile.</p>
                              <p>#3 Users couldn’t work out how to change preferences for alerts. Solution - Introduce a clickable icon that the user can easily turn on and off (Like a ‘like’ on instagram).</p>
                              <p>#4 When asked to find out what an icon meant, the user clicked on the icon, which was not clickable. Solution - Make icons clickable with an informative pop-up.</p>
                              <p>#5 Users were confused by the daily recommendation, what sport was it for? Solution - Clarify which sport the daily recommendation is for.</p>
                              <p>Below, you can see a selection of some of the solutions I created.</p>

                              <p>6.1 The next step was to focus on the UI elements of the app. I reached out to my network and peers to get some fresh feedback. I felt this was really useful, to get some new eyes on the design. From the feedback
                                collected, I deciphered which of these were relevant. I implemented about 85% of that feedback. Gaining feedback outside of your usual resource is very useful as they can offer a new perspective on the design. The
                                following screens show some highlights of the iterations that were implemented. The focus of these iterations were mainly associated with accessibility, colours & contrast, copy length & relevance.

                                  <p>What did I learn?
                                  Having worked with clients closely over the last 15 years of my career, I consider myself to be empathetic and a good listener to what users need. I was confronted in the beginning that I assumed everyone found
                                  weather apps hard to use, as this was something I had personally experienced. It was extremely insightful to interview the potential users and find the real reason behind why people stop using these apps. This
                                  re-iterated to me that you can never assume, and the only way to get solid proof, is by talking & observing users in action.
                                  <p>What would I do differently?   If I was to do this project again, I would definitely seek out more feedback from my peers more regularly, as the feedback gained during the UI stage was priceless. They highlighted so many useful insights that have
                                    allowed me to improve Vela. I would seek out more feedback at earlier stages, and more frequently throughout in future projects.</p>
                                  <p>What would be changed from a process point of view? I feel the process I followed in this case study was a well-structured one. I would have liked to conduct at least two more user testing sessions to get further insights for more iterations.</p>
